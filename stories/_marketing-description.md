Whether you’re joining your first startup or have been in the game for years, equity
compensation poses some of the most serious risks, misunderstandings, and opportunities
when it comes to modern work.

Equity compensation involves confounding terminology, legal obscurities, and many
high-stakes decisions for those who give and receive it.

questions, or thousands of dollars on lawyer fees.**
